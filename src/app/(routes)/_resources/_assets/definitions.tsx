Therefore when dialing out upon conversion, the number will then be dial as 1505 1 213 554 1212. To the user, the process is seamless.

        "Instant messaging is a form of messaging application similar to the chatting application used in desktop version in the earlier years. The delivery of messages can now be very reliable under a good data connection network, where users can view if the contacts are online or offline. It can also determined if the messages is being received or read by the receivers. There are 2 forms of how IM stores the messages. All the messages can be stored within the phone itself or it can be stored in a server. For IM that stores messages in the phone, messages will be lost if the app is installed onto another phone unless a backup is done and restore in the new phone. For server kept messages, you can still recover the messages for a period of time even if you may have installed the app in a new phone. The duration of how long to keep the messages can be configurable as well. IM has been an uproaring trend to the traditional Short Message System (SMS) used in mobile phones network. It has more interesting way to present gesture with emotion icons where traditional SMS is dull and limited to the amount of text send per message. The interface for IM also allows transmission of files across the users, which can serve like a mini colaboration tools. However, there is limitation to the use of IM, both users must installed the same application in order to use the services. Also, it has always been questionable on how secure when sending messages via IM unless service provider put in place some sort of encrpytion for point to point messaging.",
