        <>
          CCS Call Forwarding Services is to help customers to save on incoming
          calls or re-routed calls while roaming. It will work with customers
          holding with a local SIM card in the roaming country. <br />
          When subscribed to CCS Call Forwarding services, subscribers will be
          given a Singapore local number. Customer will have to inform CCS of
          the number of the local SIM card of the roaming country. CCS network
          will map our Singapore local number to the local SIM card number of
          the roaming country. Just before departure from Singapore, subscriber
          should divert their Singapore Mobile number to the Singapore Local
          number we had assigned to them. <br />
          In doing so, any incoming calls will be diverted to CCS network, where
          we will map to the subscriberâ€™s overseas SIM card. The subscriber can
          then be able to receive any incoming calls when someone dials the
          Singapore Mobile number.
