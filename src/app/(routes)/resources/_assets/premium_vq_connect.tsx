          receivable party or incorrect number dialed. <br />
          There are some unique situation where the customer numbers had been
          barred by their fixed line provider to access 15XX prefixes. In this

          release the block. <br />

This CPE is able to perform the necessary digit conversion and route all of the customer calls to CCS voice network.

          Singapore is a small country where we are a single state country. In
          other countries, usually they are made up of different states. For
          example, in China, different states number will have different area
          code. Shanghai 21, Beijing 10. To call a number from Shanghai to
          Beijing, the user will dial 0 10 12345678. For user to call from
          Shanghai to Beijing, the user will dial 0 21 12345678. This is a
          standard way to dial a domestic or inter-state call. In some
          situation, if you call within the same province, it will still work
          without dialing the leading 0. <br />
          If you are in Singapore, and your business associates business card
          states the phone numbers with a leading 0, you will need to omit the
          leading 0 and dial as follow: <br />0 21 12345678 ïƒ  1505 86 21
          12345678.

        "This is because the telecommunication business in Singapore is fully liberalized. There are many different Long Distance Calls provider, operating using different prefixes. In Singapore, we usually make IDD calls using 3-digit prefixes like 001,002, 008, 018,019 or 021 provided by FBO. For all SBO, a 4 digit prefix Is used with a leading 15 follow by 2 other numbers that is issued by IDA. For CCS, our prefix will be 1505.",

      title: "Is there possibilities for customers phone systems be hacked?",
      description: (
        <>
          In traditional phone systems where there is no data links, where there
          is no internet connectivity, the only possible tap is to physically
          access the telephone wires. Therefore, access to risers and telephone
          lines termination point at customer premises should be prohibited to
          non-essential personnel. <br />
          Due to the trend where Companies resort to linking up cross boder
          offices, a new form of phone systems are introduced. In fact, most
          phone systems providers have introduced phone systems with internet
          protocol ability. The software within the phone systems will allow
          inter-office calls at no costs. However, this will bring threats from
          the internet where hackers had made used of the new form of media to
          infiltrate the phone systems, which had resulted in heavy losses to
          customer due to to make unsolicited calls through the customer phone
          system. <br />
          However, ip enabled phone system may not be the only way where the
          system can be compromised. There are some IP phones or IP gateways
          that can be installed on direct phone lines or behind any phone
          systems, which can be a serious threat to Company phone lines being
          hacked.

    {
      title:
        "How can we make protection to prevent Internet Protocol (IP) enabled phone systems being hacked?",
      description: (
        <>
          In order to fence off attacks from hackers, the most important thing
          to do is to ensure that the default administrator password to the
          phone system is changed. Possibly, it should be change at least at
          intervals of 3 months. If the IP feature is not utilised, the phone
          system should never leave to connect to the Internet. Also, customers
          should not allow any IP enabled voice device to be installed within
          any part of the phone system unless the installation is properly
          secured either by Company Administrator or its product specialists.
          <br />
          It must be remember that service providers are only able to detect
          such attacks when there is a surge amount of calls leading to
          non-frequently called destinations. These destinations are usually
          very high in costs and somehow that even service provider are unable
          to notice due to the high volume of traffic passing through the routes
          they are using. <br />
          Therefore, prevention is always the safest bet to ensure that your
          phone system is properly secured before enabling the IP capabilities.
          If the phone systems is compromised, then it may result to serious
          losses to the customer as in most of the situation, the customer may
          have to bear the costs for all the unsolicted calls.
