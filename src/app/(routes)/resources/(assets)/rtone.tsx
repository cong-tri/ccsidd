        <>
          CCS R Tone Services is the latest services we have introduced, in
          helping customers to save costs in making calls while they are
          roaming. We have created a mobile app that will work on most popular
          mobile Operating Systems, to allow our subscribers to call via the
          app. <br /> It is a VOIP technology where calls are transmitted via
          WIFI or 3G/4G network.,

          CCS has invested very much effort in making R Tone as secure as
          possible. We have been testing our apps with an in-house developed
          systems to ensure calls are safe and secured.,

      description: (
        <>
          R Tone if under a good data network connectivity can achieve voice
          quality as good as what we are able to achieve as in our mobile call.
          We are spending good effort to improvise and ensure our voice can
          achieve its best quality even under low bandwidth connectivity.
          However, R Tone will not function if data network is not available.
          While this is so, subscribers can still fall back on the traditional
          means to make a phone call while roaming.,

        "Is there any difference between R Tone from apps like Instant Messaging (IM) applications?",
      description: (
        <>
          Yes. There is some identical differences where R Tone allows user to
          call to any numbers in the world, where the rest are probably able to
          call to another mobile who are using the same app. While we are still
          improvising the R Tone Services, it will further develop to a better
          product than the mentioned apps.
