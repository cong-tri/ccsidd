        <>
          Callback is an old technology but effective way of saving costs to
          make a call while roaming. It will be able to cut down probably about
          50% of the cost if users were to dial directly from their mobile phone
          while roaming. <br />
          For CCS Callback Service, we will provide customer with a Singapore
          Number to dial to. This number is basically a triggering number. What
          it does is that when dialed, it will be able to reach our Singapore
          network, and our system will hang up the call upon receiving it. This
          is an non-connected call which therefore it’s not chargeable. <br />
          Upon triggering, our network will do a call back to the subscriber’s
          mobile number as registered in advance with us. The subscriber will
          then answer the incoming call, and will be asked to dial the
          destination numbers and end with a # key. Customer should dial the
          country code, follow by area code, follow by destination and end with
          a # key. Once the # key is received, our system will dial to reach the
          number of the receiving party.
